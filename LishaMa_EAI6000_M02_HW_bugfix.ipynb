    "The A* (A-Star) algorithm is the most effective direct search method for finding the shortest and quickest path in a static road network, and it is also a practical algorithm for solving many search problems. As one of the heuristic search algorithms, this is for finding the lowest pass cost for paths with multiple nodes on the graph plane. The closer the distance estimate in the algorithm is to the actual value, the faster the final search will be.\n",

    "where f(n) is the estimate for each possible tentative point, which consists of two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "Part, g(n) represents the cost from the starting search point to the current point (usually expressed by the depth of a node in the search tree).\n",
    "\n",
    "The other part, h(n), represents the most important part of the heuristic search, that is, the evaluation from the current node to the target node,\n",
    "\n",
    "A sufficient condition for a heuristic algorithm with f(n)=g(n)+h(n) strategy to be an A* algorithm is:\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an optimal path from the start to the endpoint in the search tree.\n",
    "The problem domain is limited.\n",
    "The search cost of the child nodes of all nodes is > 0.\n",
    "h(n)=<h(n) (h(n) is the cost value of the actual problem).\n",
    "When these four conditions are satisfied, a heuristic algorithm with f(n)=g(n)+h(n) strategy can become the A* algorithm, and it will find the optimal solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core process of the A* algorithm is that every time the next current search point is selected, the f value is selected from all detected but not searched points (maybe different layers or not on the same branch). The smallest node is expanded. And all \"detected but not searched points\" can be arranged through a queue in ascending order of value (i.e., a priority queue). In this way, in the overall search process, as long as the first element (f value) is popped from the priority queue according to a similar breadth-first algorithm framework, the values of g, h and f are calculated for its possible child nodes until the priority queue is empty (no solution), or until the end point is found."

It can be found that this strategy is not only reasonable: assuming that the heuristic function h(m) satisfies certain conditions, the A* search is both complete and optimal.

If we divide the map into pixels, the search area is an array of 640,000 squares (a square is 3232 pixels). We will give each square a G+H sum value:\n",

This is often called a visitation because we are not sure what the amount of movement is - just an estimate. The closer the movement estimate is to the true value, the more accurate the final path will be. If the estimates stop working, it is likely that the resulting path will not be the shortest (but it may be close)."
